# Try-On Network Documentation

## Project Overview

The Try-On Network project implements a simplified version of a deep learning model for virtual try-on applications. It enables the synthesis of clothing onto a person image, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and spatial transformation techniques. This documentation provides a detailed explanation of each module, its functionality, and references for further reading.

## Modules and Functions

### TryOnDataset Class

#### Purpose

The `TryOnDataset` class manages the dataset, loading person images, corresponding clothing images, and target images (if available). It handles data augmentation and transformation.

#### Functions

- **`__init__(self, root_dir, transform=None)`**: Initializes the dataset with paths to image directories.
- **`__len__(self) -> int`**: Returns the total number of images in the dataset.
- **`__getitem__(self, idx) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]`**: Retrieves and preprocesses images from specified indices.

### FeatureExtractor Class

#### Purpose

The `FeatureExtractor` class utilizes a pretrained ResNet18 model to extract high-level features from person and clothing images.

#### Functions

- **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes ResNet18 for feature extraction.
- **`forward(self, x) -> torch.Tensor`**: Processes input images through ResNet18 to extract features.

### STN (Spatial Transformer Network) Class

#### Purpose

The `STN` class implements a Spatial Transformer Network to align clothing images spatially to match the person images.

#### Functions

- **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes the Spatial Transformer Network.
- **`forward(self, x) -> torch.Tensor`**: Applies spatial transformations (scaling, rotation) to clothing images based on learned parameters.

### ParallelDiffusion Class

#### Purpose

The `ParallelDiffusion` class integrates features extracted from both person and aligned clothing images.

#### Functions

- **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes the Parallel Diffusion module.
- **`forward(self, person_features, clothing_features) -> torch.Tensor`**: Combines features using convolutional layers to enhance feature integration.

### UNet Class

#### Purpose

The `UNet` class defines a simplified UNet architecture for generating the final try-on image.

#### Functions

- **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes the UNet architecture.
- **`forward(self, x) -> torch.Tensor`**: Executes encoding and decoding steps of UNet for image synthesis.

### TryOnNet Class

#### Purpose

The `TryOnNet` class integrates all modules (FeatureExtractor, STN, ParallelDiffusion, UNet) into a unified try-on network model.

#### Functions

- **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes and connects all submodules of the Try-On Network.
- **`forward(self, person_image, clothing_image) -> torch.Tensor`**: Defines the forward pass of the entire network, combining input images to produce a synthesized try-on image.

### Training Loop

#### Purpose

The training loop (`train_model`) manages the training process of the Try-On Network model.

#### Functions

- **`train_model(model, criterion, optimizer, train_loader, num_epochs)`**: Iterates over epochs and batches, computes loss, backpropagates gradients, and updates model parameters.
- **Checkpoint Saving**: Saves model checkpoints periodically during training.

### Evaluation

#### Purpose

The evaluation function (`evaluate_model`) tests the trained model on unseen data to assess its performance.

#### Functions

- **`evaluate_model(model, test_loader)`**: Switches the model to evaluation mode and generates try-on images for validation or testing purposes.
