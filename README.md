### 1.Identifying what Gen-Z wants
A study, published in Psychology & Marketing in 2011, found that ‚Äúshopping is largely stimulated by mood‚Äù. Gen Z‚Äôs ‚ÄúAesthetic Obsession‚Äù is on the rise : Gen Z has an insatiable need to stay on top of the aesthetic game and look Edgy, Vintage , Gore, Y2K or Softcore etc. the list is really endless. Gen Z is a pragmatic, socially conscious, and trend-focused generation born with information at their fingertips. They like engaging with brands and prefer brands that actively share info on social media. Let Myntra be a brand, where people come to check in on latest trends and new collection.

### 2.Bridging Cinematic Style Inspiration to Access
In today's fast-paced digital age, Gen-Z is constantly inspired by the styles and trends depicted in popular movies. They love copying the outfits worn by their favorite characters, mixing fashion with their fandom. However, finding similar items can be a daunting task.

### 3.Gen-Z Expectations from Today's E-commerce Recommendations 
Traditional fashion retail struggles with delivering personalized shopping experiences that align with rapidly changing trends and individual customer preferences. Many fashion e-commerce platforms today use basic recommendation algorithms that rely solely on historical purchase data or general trends. This approach often misses customers' current preferences and fails to capture the latest fashion trends or style changes from social media, resulting in a less personalized shopping experience.
